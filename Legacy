Legacy – HackTheBox OSCP Style Vulnerable Machine

Overview

Legacy is a retired machine hosted on HackTheBox. It had a focus on using a very popular known CVE and is good enumeration practice for beginners.

User Flag

Start off with an initial scan using nmap. Here, we can see SMB services running.


With this output, we can see a closed 3389, and open 139, 445. The first step would be trying to enumerate the SMB file shares and see what comes up. Since we don’t have a user name, we can start by trying to launch a null session with rpcclient.


Without credentials, we are getting an NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED so next move is to move on to smbmap.


smbmap runs but doesn’t have output. We can confirm that the box is set up to keep quiet with a manual check with smbclient too.


We can check to see if there are any ports we missed by running nmap with the -p- flags, but with only smb services expose, we need to dig deeper. Start by finding the map scripts which include smb enumeration.

ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -i smb

A list of scripts is displayed, so we can engage them with nmap.

nmap -p 139,445 10.129.1.111 --script smb-vuln-*

Now we can see that the service itself has a known CVE. We see it reports a vulnerability to ms17-010. After trying a module on Metasploit with no success, I take a look at what other vulnerabilities were reported.


ms08-067 was also flagged down as a potential vulnerability.


Since this is an easy box, Metasploit gives us root access. Grab the user flag under:

C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop
Root Flag

We can grab the root flag under:

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator
